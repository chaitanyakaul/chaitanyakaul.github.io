								<p>I’m a second semester graduate student of Computer Science at Northeastern University in Boston. I have done my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai. As part of my coursework as well as the projects I undertook during my undergrad and graduate study at Northeastern I have published 4 research papers in the field of Data Mining, Big Data Analytics as well as Unsupervised Learning Algorithms in leading conferences and journals like IEEE and ACM. </p>
							<p>As part of internships which I did in Indian Oil Limited, Mumbai and Xperia Technology Limited, Delhi I was responsible for making Android as well as iOS applications. One my applications, which I made during my time at Indian Oil was also rolled out to clients and is currently being used by around 3000+ gas station owners across India. </p>

							<p>
								Abstract:<br><br>
								The era of digitization has led computers to become the real face of handling commercial processes across a plethora of industries. As institutions today specifically in the medical domain have resorted to these virtual machines for realizing their goals, more and more medical data is being generated on a continuous basis. This data is being used in many recommendation systems which deliver a personalized individual's health profile model [1]. As a result, a colossal amount of data has been accumulated and is being continuously dumped by the medical organizations. This trend has led to the emergence of big data analytics which is being adopted by these recommendation systems in order to enhance predictive analysis foreseeing its huge upside potential in the healthcare sector. The paper discusses the transitions being observed in the healthcare domain which require the use of big data to make some useful predictions based upon analysing a variety of datasets and comparing their similar features. A detailed comparison amongst the existing prediction based algorithms is given and their key features are highlighted. Finally, the work illustrates a scope of a profile set comprising of various noteworthy implications observed from these models and discusses the benefits of big patient data. The profile set may denote a stepwise analysis of the patients health based upon various parameters, and also give a framework for effective treatment strategies.

							<p>
								Abstract:<br><br>
								Companies these days rely strongly upon their previous data history for predicting future trends in their business operations and strategies. Whether forecasting inventory or estimating sales, data mining has emerged as a new vibrant tool for extracting potential knowledge hidden inside the purchase behavior of the customer. Mining has made it possible to span over a large dataset in no time and come up with useful prediction. Building on the notion that customer’s purchase pattern plays a vital role in planning future strategies, in this paper, we focus upon several mining techniques used for understanding the customer’s purchase behavior. We analyze the purchase behavior from three different mining aspects i.e. classification, association rules, clustering technique and compare their accuracies. Thereafter, the study builds upon a scope whereby these techniques can be used to achieve a much filtered and unique dataset for analysis and also can be used for product recommendation for new customers. Finally, the study lays the scope of getting these techniques to be in sync with techniques used in forecasting such that companies can plan their sales and conduct the inventory management effectively.

							<p>
								Abstract:<br><br> Cross Platform Mobile Application Development is the development of mobile based applications sothat the development of these types of applications can be made platform-independent. A review has been madein this field while considering Integrated Development Environment is being proposed which will help asoftware developer to code an application in a single code base and deploy that single code base to multipleoperating systems meaning if a developer codes in Java for Android, the developer can deploy the same Javacode to iOS[6] subsystem. First the development of a operating system compatibility architecture which helpedto run unmodified iOS binaries on Android operating system and second phase of proposed solution helped tounderstands the cross-platform application development tools which are currently available in the market. Thethird step is to understand such cross-platform development tools in more detail and finally a mathematicalmodel based application

							<h3>Review on Self Organization in Next Generation Mobile Network</h3>
							<p>
								Abstract<br><br> This paper is the review of Self organization in future mobile network. As for now self organization is being applied to autonomic computer, or wireless network but presently self organization in mobile network is the emerging field with lot of research direction in various field related to mobile communication. In this paper a brief introduction of the term self organization and SON is presented. Also paper contains the weakness of existing system with increasing complexity. Key objectives for the deployment of self organization in system are to ensure excellent coverage and capacity with reduced interference. Deployment of SON also reduces capital operating expenditure as it eliminates the need of skilled labour. SON is mainly classified in three type's viz. self configuration, self optimization and self healing which covers almost all parameters and function related to mobile communication. Lastly it concludes with few research directions and the areas which need more research work to be done.
